                            Welcome. I’m Reuben Walker, and Mobile Atom Media (located in Orlando, FL) is my company, pride and joy, and sometime nemesis. If you are a small business owner in today’s chaotic business environment, I am sure you can relate.

                            I use the “three pillars” of content marketing to help you grow your business. What is content marketing? It is a form of “inbound” or “pull” marketing where you draw people to your site because of the search optimized content you place on it. </p>
                        <p> That content demonstrates your expertise, builds your authority, and gets the audience to like and trust you. It also moves them through the buyer’s journey and gets them to buy your products. Then it helps you retain them as happy, loyal customers who are also advocates for your business.
                        </p>
